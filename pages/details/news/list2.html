              (correspondent Wang Huaxin, Feng Wenhong, Zou Siying) From July 12 to 13, the 7th Summer Academic Exchange
              Meeting for Young Teachers of the Academy of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine and the Academic
              Annual Meeting of the Frontier Science Center for Animal Breeding and Healthy Aquaculture were held in the
              fourth comprehensive building Lecture Hall . Professor Chen Huanchun, Academician of the >Chinese Academy
              of Engineering, Professor Han Jun, Vice President of the Academy of Veterinary Medicine in China
              Agricultural University, Professor Zhu Weiyun,Nanjing Agricultural University, and the famous biologist at
              the University of Southern California, Taiwan Academia Sinica Academician Professor Zhong Zhengming was
              invited to attend the meeting. 26 scholars made special reports on hot topics in the field of animal
              husbandry and veterinary medicine. More than 300 teachers and students from our school, Wuhan University,
              China Agricultural University, Nanjing Agricultural University and other universities participated in
              academic exchanges online and offline. The meeting was presided over by 6 professors including Dean Zhao
              Shuhong, Vice Dean Yan Xianghua and Peng Guiqing.

              In the speech at the opening ceremony, Chen Huanchun said that he has studied disease prevention and
              control all his life, and he has a deep understanding of the hard truth that "a strong science and
              technology makes a country strong". At present, scientific and technological innovation has become the
              focus of the international strategic game. In the face of new situations and new challenges, we must
              achieve high-level technological self-reliance and self-improvement. First, we must adhere to the original
              leadership. Young scholars must attach importance to original and basic research, explore cutting-edge
              technologies, and enhance original innovation capabilities; Focus on key core technologies such as
              breeding, and strive to provide the people with high-quality, reliable, high-quality and inexpensive meat,
              eggs, and milk foods, demonstrating mission responsibility; third, we must adhere to systematic thinking,
              deeply integrate provenance, disease, and nutrition, and strengthen interdisciplinary research. Open up a
              new track and venture into no man's land. Finally, Chen Huanchun encouraged teachers and students to "do
              real learning" and "do real learning", and long-term efforts will pay off.

              At the exchange meeting, external experts made special reports on their respective scientific research
              achievements. With the title of "The Biological Basis of PRRSV-like NADC30 Strain Rising to the Dominant
              Strain", Han Jun expounded the replicase protein nsp2 as the fastest and largest region of PRRSV genetic
              variation, its multifunctionality and the molecular mechanism of genetic variation The basis provides a
              scientific basis for explaining the rise of NADC30-like strains to the dominant strain of PRRSV, and has
              an enlightening effect on the development of PRRSV vaccines. With the topic of "Intestinal Microbes and
              Digestive Tract Nutrition", Zhu Weiyun started from the connotation and functional interpretation of
              digestive tract nutrition, revealed the "gastrointestinal tract nutrients-microbes-host" interaction
              relationship, and further confirmed that the flora is the key factor of the intestinal tract. The strong
              guarantee of homeostasis, digestive tract nutrition is an important basis for the growth and health of the
              body. Zhong Zhengming centered on the theme of "specific regulation of poultry skin parts", shared the
              molecular and cellular regulation mechanisms of poultry feathers showing different shapes in different
              body parts, the internal structure, length, angle, symmetry and color patterns of feathers, etc. In terms
              of microevolution and development, it explores the related issues of avian feather genetics and
              development, as well as epigenetic modification.

              Experts from the school made relevant sharing on hot topics such as provenance safety of the livestock and
              poultry industry, animal disease prevention and control, and efficient green production. Aiming at the
              problem that animal epidemics have greatly restricted the development of animal husbandry and the research
              on the interaction between animal influenza virus and host in my country is relatively weak, Professor
              Zhou Hongbo, conducted research on "interaction between animal influenza virus and host protein",
              explaining The new strategy of immune escape of animal influenza virus was revealed, the new mechanism of
              replication and pathogenicity of animal influenza virus and the new mechanism of cross-species
              transmission of avian influenza virus were revealed, which provided a biological basis for the prevention
              and control of animal influenza. In order to realize the independent control of the seed source and solve
              the "stuck neck" problem in the animal husbandry seed industry, Professor Xie Shengsong's team innovated a
              high-throughput mining technology system for pig disease-resistant targets, and discovered a number of
              disease-resistant targets that mediate important pathogenic infections. Developed gene editing tools with
              independent intellectual property rights to realize the breeding of gene-edited disease-resistant pigs.

              At the end of the exchange meeting, Liu Xingbin, secretary of the party committee of the college, made a
              concluding speech. He said that in the future, we must persist in organizing academic exchange activities,
              facilitate interdisciplinary interaction, promote the organic integration of free exploration and
              organized scientific research, build a better academic ecology, and let the collision of ideas generate
              more academic sparks.

              Jin Meijun, a graduate student of the 2022 class, shared after the event: "Ms. Zhu Weiyun's academic
              report has a novel angle, which inspired me to develop ideas and find new entry points when doing
              research. Communicate more with people in different research fields and listen more. Reporting is a good
              way to effectively broaden your horizons!"
