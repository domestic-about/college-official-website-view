          The Academy of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine held the 7th Summer Academic Exchange Meeting for Young
          Teachers and the Academic Annual Meeting of the Frontier Science Center for Animal Breeding and Healthy

        <p class="info-label"> (correspondent Wang Huaxin, Feng Wenhong, Zou Siying) From July 12 to 13, the 7th Summer
          Academic Exchange Meeting for Young Teachers of the Academy of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine and the
          Academic Annual Meeting of the Frontier Science Center for Animal Breeding and Healthy Aquaculture were held
          in the fourth comprehensive building Lecture Hall . Professor Chen Huanchun, Academician of the Chinese
          Academy of Engineering, Professor Han Jun, Vice President of the Academy of Veterinary Medicine in China
          Agricultural University, Professor Zhu Weiyun,Nanjing Agricultural University, and the famous biologist at the
          University of Southern California, Taiwan Academia Sinica Academician Professor Zhong Zhengming was invited to
          attend the meeting. 26 scholars made special reports on hot topics in the field of animal husbandry and
          veterinary medicine. More than 300 teachers and students from our school, Wuhan University, China Agricultural
          University, Nanjing Agricultural University and other universities participated in academic exchanges online
          and offline. The meeting was presided over by 6 professors including Dean Zhao Shuhong, Vice Dean Yan Xianghua
          and Peng Guiqing.</p>
        <p class="info-label">In the speech at the opening ceremony, Chen Huanchun said that he has studied disease
          prevention and control all his life, and he has a deep understanding of the hard truth that "a strong science
          and technology makes a country strong". At present, scientific and technological innovation has become the
          focus of the international strategic game. In the face of new situations and new challenges, we must achieve
          high-level technological self-reliance and self-improvement. First, we must adhere to the original leadership.
          Young scholars must attach importance to original and basic research, explore cutting-edge technologies, and
          enhance original innovation capabilities; Focus on key core technologies such as breeding, and strive to
          provide the people with high-quality, reliable, high-quality and inexpensive meat, eggs, and milk foods,
          demonstrating mission responsibility; third, we must adhere to systematic thinking, deeply integrate
          provenance, disease, and nutrition, and strengthen interdisciplinary research. Open up a new track and venture
          into no man's land. Finally, Chen Huanchun encouraged teachers and students to "do real learning" and "do real
          learning", and long-term efforts will pay off.</p>
        <p class="info-label">At the exchange meeting, external experts made special reports on their respective
          scientific research achievements. With the title of "The Biological Basis of PRRSV-like NADC30 Strain Rising
          to the Dominant Strain", Han Jun expounded the replicase protein nsp2 as the fastest and largest region of
          PRRSV genetic variation, its multifunctionality and the molecular mechanism of genetic variation The basis
          provides a scientific basis for explaining the rise of NADC30-like strains to the dominant strain of PRRSV,
          and has an enlightening effect on the development of PRRSV vaccines. With the topic of "Intestinal Microbes
          and Digestive Tract Nutrition", Zhu Weiyun started from the connotation and functional interpretation of
          digestive tract nutrition, revealed the "gastrointestinal tract nutrients-microbes-host" interaction
          relationship, and further confirmed that the flora is the key factor of the intestinal tract. The strong
          guarantee of homeostasis, digestive tract nutrition is an important basis for the growth and health of the
          body. Zhong Zhengming centered on the theme of "specific regulation of poultry skin parts", shared the
          molecular and cellular regulation mechanisms of poultry feathers showing different shapes in different body
          parts, the internal structure, length, angle, symmetry and color patterns of feathers, etc. In terms of
          microevolution and development, it explores the related issues of avian feather genetics and development, as
          well as epigenetic modification.
        </p>
        <p class="info-label">Experts from the school made relevant sharing on hot topics such as provenance safety of
          the livestock and poultry industry, animal disease prevention and control, and efficient green production.
          Aiming at the problem that animal epidemics have greatly restricted the development of animal husbandry and
          the research on the interaction between animal influenza virus and host in my country is relatively weak,
          Professor Zhou Hongbo, conducted research on "interaction between animal influenza virus and host protein",
          explaining The new strategy of immune escape of animal influenza virus was revealed, the new mechanism of
          replication and pathogenicity of animal influenza virus and the new mechanism of cross-species transmission of
          avian influenza virus were revealed, which provided a biological basis for the prevention and control of
          animal influenza. In order to realize the independent control of the seed source and solve the "stuck neck"
          problem in the animal husbandry seed industry, Professor Xie Shengsong's team innovated a high-throughput
          mining technology system for pig disease-resistant targets, and discovered a number of disease-resistant
          targets that mediate important pathogenic infections. Developed gene editing tools with independent
          intellectual property rights to realize the breeding of gene-edited disease-resistant pigs.</p>
        <p class="info-label">At the end of the exchange meeting, Liu Xingbin, secretary of the party committee of the
          college, made a concluding speech. He said that in the future, we must persist in organizing academic exchange
          activities, facilitate interdisciplinary interaction, promote the organic integration of free exploration and
          organized scientific research, build a better academic ecology, and let the collision of ideas generate more
          academic sparks.</p>

        <p class="info-label">Jin Meijun, a graduate student of the 2022 class, shared after the event: "Ms. Zhu
          Weiyun's academic report has a novel angle, which inspired me to develop ideas and find new entry points when
          doing research. Communicate more with people in different research fields and listen more. Reporting is a good
          way to effectively broaden your horizons!"</p>
