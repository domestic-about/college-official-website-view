          <h3>[Dancing Lion Mountain] Dongke Hospital made great achievements in the 2023 "Lion Mountain Cup" table
            tennis competition
          </h3>
          <p class="label">
            (Correspondent: Yuan Guxin Photography: Lu Mengyang) From June 10th to 11th, the 2023 "Lion Mountain Cup"
            table tennis match of Huazhong Agricultural University was successfully held in the East Gymnasium. The
            competition was jointly organized by the Huazhong Agricultural University Committee of the Communist Youth
            League, the Propaganda Department of the Party Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University, the
            Undergraduate School and the Sports Department, and it was launched for all students in the school. The
            table tennis team of our school won the runner-up in the men's team competition and the fourth place in the
            women's team competition. <br></br>

            The "Lion Rock Cup" table tennis competition is divided into four events: team competition, men's singles,
            women's singles, and mixed doubles. The competition adopts the knockout system, with two wins in three games
            in each game, and the eight-in-four knockout round, semi-finals, and finals adopt a best-of-five game
            system, and all games use the 11-point system. <br></br>

            Before the competition, the staff announced to all members the strict and standardized requirements of the
            competition, and explained the relevant precautions to the participants.

            The competition will be held in two days. On June 10, there will be team competitions and some mixed doubles
            competitions. In line with the spirit of "Being No. 1 in sports medicine and medicine", the table tennis
            team of Animal Science and Technology Hospital, defying difficulties and striving to forge ahead, won the
            runner-up in the men's team competition and the fourth place in the women's team competition.<br></br>

            At 7:30 am on June 11, the group stage officially started, and all contestants were randomly divided into
            several groups to compete simultaneously. During the interval between games, the athletes actively warmed
            up, got familiar with the field, and made full preparations for the next game. The group match was going on
            tensely and orderly. The contestants worked hard based on the principle of "playing every ball seriously".
            The referee and other staff cooperated tacitly. The atmosphere was high during the game, and game points
            appeared many times. After several rounds of competition and elimination, Peng Kehan ​​won the seventh place
            in the men's singles. The men's and women's mixed doubles competition in the afternoon is still very
            stalemate. One side takes the lead temporarily, and the opponent immediately catches up. After several
            rounds of fierce competition, Yang Guang and Liu Yadan from our school won the fourth place in the men's and
            women's mixed doubles. After the competition, the staff of the sports department awarded medals and
            certificates to the winning athletes and took a group photo.<br></br>

            After the competition, Peng Kehan ​​from class 2204 of Dongke was quite impressed: "What impressed me the
            most in this competition is that in the men's team competition semi-finals, in the disadvantage of two
            consecutive defeats, senior Jian Yaobang calmly resisted the external pressure, Clinging to the score at the
            critical moment, turning the game against the wind, and winning the cheers of the audience." He said that
            the Lion Rock Cup table tennis match made him fully aware of the importance of unity, persistence, hard work
            and maintaining a good attitude in team competition, and He said that he would practice harder, accumulate
            competition experience, and strive to get a better ranking in the next competition, so as to add luster to
            the School of Animal Medicine.<br></br>
