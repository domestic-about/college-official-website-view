          college has aimed to cultivate leading talents in the animal husbandry and veterinary industry, and has
          steadily promoted the construction of first-class disciplines facing the world's cutting-edge science and
          technology and the country's major needs. Academician Chen Huanchun established the "Huanchun Fund" teaching
          scholarship six years ago, and led the establishment of the Animal Diseases academic journal, aiming to
          further deepen talent training and encourage technological innovation. With the support of cooperative
          enterprises, the School of Animal Science and Technology has set up enterprise scholarships to encourage
          students to develop in an all-round way and grow into a new type of pastoral medicine talents with excellent
          comprehensive quality.

        <p>Academician Chen Huanchun's speech (photographed by correspondent Yu Siyi)
        </p>
        <p class="label">Academician Chen Huanchun said in his speech that the key to international competition and
          China's development today is scientific and technological innovation, and the key to scientific and
          technological innovation lies in talents. In the face of major changes unseen in a century, we must develop
          the cause of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, as well as the development of all mankind and the
          world. This is the mentality and goal we should have to seize opportunities and meet challenges. He emphasized
          that products are the key to building a country with talents, strengthening it with technology, and
          rejuvenating it with industry. There is no distinction between basic research and applied research in the
          minds of real scientists. He sent a message to the students to work hard: "The world belongs to young people.
          Young students should open their horizons and stand higher. They must see the new trend and new future of the
          country's development and rejuvenation. Students have caught up with the good times and shoulder the
          responsibility. To carry out the historical mission of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, you must study
          hard and give full play to and contribute your ingenuity."

          At the ensuing 21st Entrepreneur Forum of Dongfang Medical College, Academician Chen Huanchun and Professor
          Zhao Shuhong of our school, Huang Dapeng, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Guilin Liyuan Grain, Oil
          and Foodstuff Group Co., Ltd., and Yang Yang, Executive Vice President of Wuhan Huayang Animal Health Group
          Co., Ltd. Jian made reports one after another.

          "The export of science and technology is the product, and the product leads the development." Academician Chen
          Huanchun centered on the theme of "focusing on the major needs of the country to do a good job in scientific
          research". The three major problems of prominent food safety and serious environmental pollution make it clear
          that to improve agricultural production efficiency in the future, we must adhere to scientific and
          technological innovations in the agricultural biological seed industry, technological innovations in feed and
          fertilizer resources, technological innovations in the prevention and control of animal and plant diseases,
          insects, and weeds. Machinery and smart agriculture, food processing technology innovation, environmental
          restoration and ecological protection six scientific research innovation directions.

          Professor Zhao Shuhong gave a report titled "Innovation and Development of Animal Breeding Science and
          Technology". She emphasized that the revitalization of the seed industry is a national strategy, and the
          safety of seed sources is related to national security. It is necessary to promote the national seed industry
          to realize the self-reliance and self-reliance of seed industry technology, and the self-control of seed
          sources. At present, the international seed industry is ushering in the technological revolution of modern
          biological breeding marked by the integration and development of gene editing, synthetic biology, artificial
          intelligence and other technologies. The competitiveness of the main enterprises is not strong. We must seize
          the opportunity, accelerate innovation, and solidly promote the national breeding joint research and livestock
          and poultry genetic improvement plan through the implementation of major biological breeding projects, so as
          to make a turnaround in the seed industry and realize the leapfrog development of the seed industry.

          Huang Dapeng talked about choices and growth with his classmates based on three stories of young farmers and
          herdsmen. He quoted Marx's classic quotations to encourage students: "If we choose the profession that can
          work best for mankind, then the burden cannot overwhelm us, because it is a sacrifice for everyone; what we
          enjoy then will not be Poor, finite, selfish pleasures, our happiness will belong to millions, our cause will
          live on silently, but it will work forever, and over our ashes noble people will sprinkle Tears." Yang Jian
          conveyed the idea that "experience is sometimes more important than academic qualifications" through personal
          experience, and encouraged students to practice by themselves, find real problems in practice, and really
          solve problems.
