        <h3>5 achievements of our school won the 2022 Outstanding Scientific Research Achievement Award of Higher
          Education Institutions</h3>
        <p class="label">
          Nanhu News Network (Correspondent Zhang Yao) Recently, the Ministry of Education announced the results of the
          2022 Higher Education Outstanding Scientific Research Achievement Award (Science and Technology). As the first
          completion unit, our school won 5 awards, including 2 first prizes and 2 second prizes 2 awards and 1 youth
          award. <br></br>

          The team of Professor Yan Jianbing from the School of Plant Science and Technology won the first prize of the
          Natural Science Award for the achievement of "Analysis of the Reproductive Development Mechanism of Maize
          Driven by Plant Single-Cell Technology". Aiming at the analysis of the genetic mechanism of maize reproductive
          development, the project pioneered a series of plant single-cell omics sequencing technologies, which analyzed
          the laws and mechanisms of genetic recombination differences between male and female maize through
          single-spore sequencing, and provided theoretical guidance for the selection of breeding parents; Genetic
          sequencing revealed that maize male gametes have methylation reprogramming characteristics, providing a new
          perspective for understanding reproductive development; pollen single-nucleus sequencing clarified the
          mechanism of maize haploid induction and male sterility, providing theoretical support for the development of
          new breeding technologies. Single-cell methylation sequencing technology was named one of the annual
          technological innovations by Molecular Plant magazine. <br></br>

          The team of Professor Yan Xianghua from the School of Animal Science and Technology and the School of
          Veterinary
          Medicine won the first prize of the Natural Science Award for the achievement "Leucine regulates the protein
          metabolism and energy metabolism of early weaned piglets". This project confirmed for the first time that
          early
          weaning stress can induce autophagy in piglets, clarified the mechanism of leucine as a signaling molecule to
          regulate protein metabolism (autophagy) through the two pathways of Barkor-mTOR and miRNA-ULK1, and analyzed
          the
          role of leucine in regulating protein metabolism (autophagy). Mechanisms by which signaling molecules promote
          energy metabolism in piglet intestinal epithelium and regulate energy metabolism in skeletal muscle of early
          weaned piglets. For the first time, the academic point of view that "leucine doubles as a protein synthesis
          substrate and a signal molecule" is proposed.

          Professor Liu Xiaolei from the School of Animal Science and Technology and the School of Veterinary Medicine
          won
          the Youth Science Award. This is the first time our school has won this award. The average annual number of
          awards awarded by the Ministry of Education does not exceed 10. Liu Xiaolei created the world's first pig
          integrated omics knowledge base based on artificial intelligence and big data technology, and opened up the
          "last mile" from genome-wide association analysis to key gene screening; developed genome breeding algorithms
          and software with independent intellectual property rights , realized the efficient calculation of big data
          for
          genome selection and matching of millions of populations, fully adapted to the domestic "Kunpeng" ecology, and
          applied it in leading pig breeding companies such as COFCO and Yangxiang. The scientific research version was
          adopted by more than 60 countries including the United States and Denmark The national use has improved the
          level of innovation in the field of genome breeding big data computing in my country.

          The "Abiotic Stress Response Mechanism and Molecular Regulatory Network of Citrus" completed by the team of
          Professor Liu Jihong from the School of Horticulture and Forestry won the second prize of the Natural Science
          Award. Aiming at the main abiotic adversity that restricts the development of citrus industry, the project
          revealed the molecular mechanism of citrus accumulating metabolites such as putrescine and proline in response
          to adversity, and built the most comprehensive transcriptional regulation network for putrescine synthesis in
          the world, which will help citrus resist stress. The creation of germplasm has laid an important theoretical
          foundation. Based on theoretical research, the technology of citrus fruit overwintering and keeping trees
          fresh
          has been developed with the core of spraying exogenous polyamines.

          ovulation regulation and identification, obtained 6 new veterinary drug certificates, developed 6 hormone
          products, 3 types of equipment, and 7 computer software, some of the achievements have been transformed, and
          significant economic benefits have been obtained.
