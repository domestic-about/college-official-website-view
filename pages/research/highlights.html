            <p class="info-label">
              The research team, led by Professor Cao Shengbo, has focused on studying the pathogenesis and immune
              mechanisms of vector-borne zoonotic diseases, as well as developing prevention and control technologies.
              They have made important discoveries regarding the mechanisms by which Japanese encephalitis virus and
              Zika virus cause damage to the central nervous system and reproductive system. Additionally, the team has
              successfully developed new diagnostic reagents and vaccines for arboviruses. Their development of vaccines
              and diagnostic kits for porcine Japanese encephalitis has made notable contributions to the prevention and
              control of the disease, resulting in positive economic outcomes. As a recognition of their achievements,
              the team has been awarded the first prize of the Hubei Provincial Scientific and Technological Progress

            <p class="info-label">
              Professor Shuhong Zhao's team has developed a high-throughput and low-cost genotyping technology. This
              technology enriches the key genetic variations in liquid phase through specific probes, and then uses
              genome sequencing for high-throughput genotyping. This technology has the advantages of flexible upgrade,
              large amount of information, and low detection cost, providing a new technology to solve the bottleneck
              problem of gene chips. In addition, based on independent liquid chip technology and the latest genome
              research achievements, professor Zhao’s team designed a pig 80K functional site gene chip. The chip site
              design integrates information on pig genome enhancers, promoters, and coding region functional mutation
              sites, breaking the traditional theory of linkage imbalance, and significantly improving the accuracy of
              breeding value evaluation. The use of the new liquid chip technology can not only reduce breeding costs
              but also improve breeding efficiency.

              cells. The team has found the epigenetic regulation of porcine fertilized and cloned embryos, including of
              chromatin accessibility, histone modification, DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture. These findings
              help to increase the pig cloning efficiency by 4.4 times, and provide an effective technical means for the

              The research team led by Prof. Xianghua Yan mainly focused on the roles of gut microbiome in several host
              phenotypes, including intestinal health, feed efficiency, reproductive performance, and meat quality of
              pigs. The team has screened the key gut microbial species and their metabolites associated with these host
              phenotypes from native pig resources by the use of the fecal microbiota transplantation, metagenomics, 16S
              rDNA/ITS gene amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics. Manipulation of these key gut microbial species and
              their metabolites may be the promising nutritional strategy for improving the intestinal health and
              economic efficiency in sustainable pig production. These relevant papers made by the team have been
              published in the international peer-review journals, including Cell host & Microbe,and Microbiome. The

            <p class="info-label">
              Environmentally friendly farming is a critical issue closely tied to the green, healthy, and sustainable
              development of the livestock industry. According to available information, China faces an annual economic
              loss of approximately 30 billion yuan of pig farming due to heat stress alone. Moreover, factors such as
              stress-related reduction in feed conversion rates and mortality rates exert additional pressures on the
              environment. On the other hand, the production of about 3.8 billion tons of livestock and poultry manure
              annually presents an environmental challenge. In light of these concerns, we have been extensively
              involved in interdisciplinary research within the domains of animal genetics and environmental
              engineering. This engagement has led to the pursuit of applied basic research, focusing on the intricate
              interplay between genetics, anti-stress and environmental control. Additionally, we have championed the
              principles of green and healthy breeding practices. This dedication has resulted in the publication of
              over 70 scholarly papers in prestigious journals such as the International Journal of Biological Sciences,
              Cell Death and Disease, Analytical Chemistry, Communications Biology, and Genetics Selection Evolution,
              both domestically and internationally. Furthermore, the applicant's contributions have extended to
              securing 15 national invention patents.
