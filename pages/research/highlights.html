          <div class="title">Green Super Rice
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The research team led by Academician Zhang Qifa has successfully developed the hybrid
            rice resistant to rice stem borers and other main rice diseases, whose yield and quality traits are
            equivalent to those of the hybrid rice varieties largely promoted currently by using molecular
            marker-assisted selection technology. The new rice with a marked productivity increase is remarkably
            cost-saving, and environmentally friendly. On August 17, 2009, the genetically modified rice varieties
            "Huahui 1" and "Bt Shanyou 63" developed by the team became the first genetically modified rice varieties
            granted Production and Application Safety Certificate in China
          </p>
          <div class="title">Double-low Hybrid Rapeseed
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The research team led by Academician Fu Tingdong has successfully bred the quality
            double-low rapeseed – Huaza Series, Huashuang series and other new varieties, bringing about 10-20%
            increase
            in yield as compared to the conventional ones. The quality double-low rapeseed varieties have been
            popularized in Central China with an accumulative extension area of about 10 million hectares, and have
            generated an economic benefit of 4.5 billion RMB.

          <div class="title">Lean Hubei White Swine
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The research team led by Academician Xiong Yuanzhu has been devoted to the breeding and
            promotion of lean swine. In the 1980s, the team succeeded in breeding the Hubei White Swine and its family
            by
            applying the modern Quantitative genetic theories and Duhu Pig sold well in Hong Kong and Macau. Professor
            Chen Huanchun worked out the breeding and selecting techniques to produce lean swine varieties lean swine
            and
            bred 7 specialized parent strains, forming a distinctive lean swine production system. The team has
            developed
            a lean swine breeding technology system as well as achievements popularization service system, creating
            enormous social and economic benefits.

          <div class="title">Animal Vaccines
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The research team led by an academician Chen Huanchun has systematically carried out
            basic and
            preventive technology research on major animal epizootics, developed over 30 varieties of new vaccines and
            rapid
            diagnostic kits. The team has won 1 second prize of National Scientific and Technological Progress Award,
            2
            first prizes of Hubei Provincial Scientific and Technological Progress Award, obtained 14 patents, 11 new
            veterinary medicine registration certificates, and 4 national key new products certificates. These
            products have
            effectively prevented and controlled the major epizootics in Chinese livestock industry, bringing great
            economic
            and social benefits

          <div class="title">High-quality Citrus
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The research team led by professor Zhang Wencai and professor Deng Xiuxin has bred 11
            citrus
            varieties which are greatly popularized in Central South China, with a coverage rate of more than 80% in
            the 8 main
            citrus producing areas, supplying 0.1 million high-quality virus-free seedlings and more than 0.1 million
            scions to
            citrus production bases there. With the high-yield and high-efficiency citrus cultivation techniques and
            the quality
            seedlings bred by the team, seedling and scion nurseries have been established in over 30 counties across
            the
            country, with a popularization area of more than 0.1 million hectares</p>
          <div class="title">Potato Microtuber
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The potato microtuber production technology developed by Professor Xie Conghua has
            resolved the
            problem that seed potatoes easily degrade due to virus infection; 3 square meters breeding space in lab is
            sufficient to cultivate seed potatoes free of pathogens for 10 hectares farmland, thus completely solving
            the
            problem of seed-quality degradation. This technology has changed the production mode of potato
            cultivation, saving a
            large amount of breeding area and seed potatoes.</p>
          <div class="title">Super Sweet Maize
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">"Huatianyu 1" is a high-quality, early-maturing and high-yielding super sweet maize
            single-cross
            hybrid and was selected and bred for 8 years by two generations of maize breeders of HZAU using
            high-quality maize
            germplasms from home and abroad. Between 2000 and 2001, "Huatianyu 1" respectively grown in East China and
            Southeast
            China Special Maize Regional Trials sites which exhibited early maturity, excellent appearance and good
            taste. It
            passed the state-level verification in 2003, and became one of the first domestic new varieties of super
            sweet Maize
            verified by the state.

          <div class="title">Transgenic Tomato
          </div>
          <p class="info-label">The transgenic tomato with prolonged shelf life bred by Professor Ye Zhibiao – "Huafan
            1"
            is the
            first new variety of genetically modified crops approved by the Ministry of Agriculture to enter
            commercial
            production in China and won the first prize of Hubei Provincial Scientific and Technological Progress
            Award in 2002.
            This variety was produced by using the ACO genes cloned from tomatoes and transferring them into tomatoes
            with
            anti-sense construction technology so as to produce a transgenic tomato germplasm with long shelf life
            quality. A
            new generation of hybrid varieties characteristic of prolonged shelf life was thus bred with the new
            breeding
            techniques in combination with the conventional ones.</p>
          <div class="title">High-yielding and Multi-resistant Hybrid Cotton
          </div>
          <p class="label">The new cotton varieties developed by the research team led by Professor Zhang Xianlong,
            using modern
            biotechnology tools and methods, feature easy growth, early maturity, no premature aging, smooth boll
            opening, good
            fiber, high yield, anti-blight, anti-yellow wilt disease and good insect resistance. 3 varieties of hybrid
            cotton
            have passed the variety verification by Hubei, Jiangxi and Henan provinces. Another hybrid combination is
            ranking
            first in national regional trials, which is expected to be popularized widely and achieve good social and
            economic
            benefits</p>
          <div class="title">Biodiesel
          </div>
          <p class="label">After more than 10 years of research, the Biomass Energy Research Center of HZAU created
            the
            technology and production line for direct conversion of rapeseed into biodiesel - extract oil directly
            from rapeseed
            with a specific solvent and then transform the oil into biodiesel with relevant technology. This
            production process
            brings broader source of raw material, simpler production process, much lower production costs, and less
            secondary
            pollution to biodiesel production. Furthermore, protein concentrate can be extracted from meal after
            biodiesel
            production and reclaim phytic acid, rapeseed polysaccharides, rapeseed polyphenols from the liquid waste
            after
            protein concentrate extraction, resulting in a significant increase in enterprise income, as well as
            remarkable
            economic and environmental benefits</p>
