                  knowledge graph and AI course construction in the D202 conference room of the fourth complex building.
                  Invited Li Siqi, a gold course consultant of Wisdom Tree Network Hubei Province, to give a report on
                  "Construction of Knowledge Graphs, AI Empowering First-Class Disciplines and New Forms of Courses".
                  The
                  event was hosted by Ren Zhuqing.

                  Li Siqi described the importance and necessity of knowledge map construction from four aspects:
                  digital
                  background, digital teaching reform, innovation trend of quality courses, and application scope of
                  knowledge map. He introduced the construction model of the knowledge map, explained the role and
                  interrelationship of "knowledge", "problem" and "ability" in the construction of the map; introduced
                  the
                  content of the subject knowledge map; An important application of the construction process, through
                  the
                  use of artificial intelligence, functions such as the establishment of a single learning space and the
                  optimization of course resources can be achieved. Finally, through the typical school case of
