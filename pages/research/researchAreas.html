                <p class="label">In addition to drug research, our department is involved in toxicology studies,
                  evaluating the safety and toxicity of various substances that may be encountered by animals in their
                  environment or through veterinary treatments. We strive to identify potential risks and develop
                  strategies for minimizing toxicity and ensuring the safe use of veterinary drugs.

                <p class="label">Through our research and teaching activities, we aim to contribute to the advancement
                  of veterinary medicine, promote animal health and welfare, and provide valuable insights and guidance
                  for veterinarians, researchers, and the veterinary pharmaceutical industry.

                  We conduct studies and research to understand the determinants of health and disease in populations,
                  including social, behavioral, environmental, and biological factors. Our goal is to identify risk
                  factors, patterns of disease occurrence, and health disparities, and to develop evidence-based
                  strategies for disease prevention, health promotion, and health protection
                </p>
                <p class="label">Our department offers education and training in public health principles and practices,
                  equipping students with the knowledge and skills to address public health challenges. We collaborate
                  with governmental and non-governmental organizations, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders
                  to implement public health programs and interventions aimed at improving population health outcomes.
