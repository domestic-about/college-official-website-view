                  <p class="label">
                    The multifunctional metal-organic framework (MOF) materials with core-shell structure and
                    sulfur-doping characteristics were designed for highly efficient adsorption and synergistic
                    degradation of antibacterial drugs. This results were published in the Chemical Engineering Journal
                    as “S-doped core-shell heterojunction fenton catalyst (Fe3O4-S@PVP@UIO-66-(SH)2) for enhanced
                    activation of hydroxyl radical: synergistic enrichment and degradation mechanism”. The low-valence S
                    species was innovatively doped into Fe3O4 in the form of MOF, and a S-doped core-shell
                    heterojunction multiphase fenton catalyst was successfully prepared by a simple one-pot method.
                    Based on the theoretical calculation and experimental results, the mechanism of eliminating the
                    deactivation of the active site of iron by the introduction of non-metals was investigated
                    systematically.

                    infections via a new antibacterial mechanism. The relevant achievements were published in Science

                    PCN-224 as PDT platform for providing ROS, incorporating arginine (Arg) as NO donor to cascade with
                    ROS to produce more lethal ONOO- and promote immune response, and coating with gelatin as targeting
                    agent and persistent Arg provider. The composite nanosystems showed targeting and synergistic

                      graph and AI course construction in the D202 conference room of the fourth complex building.
                      Invited Li Siqi, a gold course consultant of Wisdom Tree Network Hubei Province, to give a report
                      on "Construction of Knowledge Graphs, AI Empowering First-Class Disciplines and New Forms of
                      Courses". The event was hosted by Ren Zhuqing. Li Siqi described the importance and necessity of
                      knowledge map construction from four aspects: digital background, digital teaching reform,
                      innovation trend of quality courses, and application scope of knowledge map. He introduced the
                      construction model of the knowledge map, explained the role and interrelationship of "knowledge",
                      "problem" and "ability" in the construction of the map; introduced the content of the subject
                      knowledge map; An important application of the construction process, through the use of artificial
                      intelligence, functions such as the establishment of a single learning space and the optimization
                      of course resources can be achieved. Finally, through the typical school case of knowledge graph,
