                    species was innovatively doped into Fe3O4 in the form of MOF, and a S-doped core-shell
                    heterojunction multiphase fenton catalyst was successfully prepared by a simple one-pot method.
                    Based on the theoretical calculation and experimental results, the mechanism of eliminating the
                    deactivation of the active site of iron by the introduction of non-metals was investigated
                    systematically.

                      On the morning of July 19, the School of Animal Medicine held a training meeting on knowledge
                      graph and AI course construction in the D202 conference room of the fourth complex building.
                      Invited Li Siqi, a gold course consultant of Wisdom Tree Network Hubei Province, to give a report
                      on "Construction of Knowledge Graphs, AI Empowering First-Class Disciplines and New Forms of
                      Courses". The event was hosted by Ren Zhuqing. Li Siqi described the importance and necessity of
                      knowledge map construction from four aspects: digital background, digital teaching reform,
                      innovation trend of quality courses, and application scope of knowledge map. He introduced the
                      construction model of the knowledge map, explained the role and interrelationship of "knowledge",
                      "problem" and "ability" in the construction of the map; introduced the content of the subject
                      knowledge map; An important application of the construction process, through the use of artificial
                      intelligence, functions such as the establishment of a single learning space and the optimization
                      of course resources can be achieved. Finally, through the typical school case of knowledge graph,
                      the application of knowledge graph is shown to the teacher
