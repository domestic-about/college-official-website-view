          <h3> Huazhong Agricultural University Animal Science and Technology College </h3>
          <p class="text-wrap-label">
            The College of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine are among the earliest
            established faculties at Huazhong Agricultural University. In 1898, under the leadership of Governor-General
            Zhang Zhidong, the Hubei Provincial Agricultural School (predecessor of Huazhong Agricultural University)
            was founded with the aim of attracting aspiring individuals interested in agricultural studies and research
            on crop cultivation and animal husbandry. In 1902, it was renamed as Hubei Provincial Higher Agricultural
            School and began offering programs in agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. In 1916, the school split
            into two, and Hubei Provincial Second Higher Agricultural School established a three-year program in
            veterinary medicine. In 1952, as part of the nationwide restructuring of institutions, the Department of
            Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was established within Huazhong Agricultural College, with
            Professor Qin Liran, a renowned veterinarian, serving as its first department head. In October 1995, the
            College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine was established at Huazhong Agricultural University, which
            was later renamed as the College of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine in
            July 2002.

              Our college currently houses 6 national-level research institutions, 1 collaborative innovation center, 3
              provincial-level international science and technology cooperation bases, and 18 provincial and
              ministerial-level research institutions. Additionally, we have been approved to establish a national
              experimental teaching demonstration center for veterinary medicine, an education and agriculture
              cooperation
              talent training base for pig farming in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of
              Agriculture, as well as an innovation activity base for undergraduate students majoring in animal science
              and technology in Hubei Province.</br>

              Since 2011 to 2017, we have published over 1600 articles of various types, with nearly 1200 SCI-indexed
              papers. The average annual number of published SCI papers is 169, with the highest impact factor being
              32.438. Among them, there are more than 10 SCI papers with impact factors above 10. We have also achieved
              13
              identified scientific results and won a total of 55 awards at various levels for scientific and
              technological achievements. Among these, we received one first-class national scientific and technological
              progress award and one second-class award as the first completion unit. We also received one second-class
              national scientific and technological invention award, one outstanding contribution award for scientific
              and
              technological achievements in Hubei Province, seven first-class and two second-class Hubei Province
              scientific and technological progress awards, as well as two second-class and one second-class Hubei
              Province technical invention awards.

              Furthermore, we have obtained 218 authorized patents, 11 certificates for newly approved veterinary drugs,
              and have formulated 12 national standards and 5 local standards.
