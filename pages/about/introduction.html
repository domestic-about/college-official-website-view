              The College of Animal Science & Technology and College of Veterinary Medicine is one of the earliest
              departments established at Huazhong Agricultural University. In 1898, Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Hubei
              and Hunan provinces, founded the Hubei Agricultural School (predecessor of Huazhong Agricultural
              University) and invited those who were interested in pursuing agricultural studies to join the school and
              study plant cultivation and animal husbandry. In 1902, the school was renamed Hubei Higher Agricultural
              School and began offering three disciplines: agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. In 1916, the
              school was divided into two, and the Hubei Second Senior Agricultural School established the Department of
              Veterinary Medicine (3-year program).
            </p>
            <p class="img-label">

            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              In 1952, as part of a nationwide restructuring of colleges and departments, the Animal Husbandry and
              Veterinary Department was established at Huazhong Agricultural College, with Professor Qin Liran, a
              renowned veterinarian, serving as the first department head. In October 1995, the College of Animal
              Science and Veterinary Medicine was established at Huazhong Agricultural University, and in July 2002, it
              was renamed the College of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine.
            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              Over the more than 70 years since its establishment, the college has upheld the principles of “unity,
              rigor, pragmatism, and innovation” and carried forward the spirit of “innovation, creation, and
              entrepreneurship.” It has adhered to the concept of “talent-oriented, technology-driven, and
              industry-advancing,” making great efforts to promote the development and growth of the college. As a
              result, the college has developed a distinctive discipline advantage and a comprehensive educational
              system.
            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              The college comprises nine departments, including the Department of Animal Genetics and Breeding,
              Department of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Department of Animal Reproduction and Special Economic
              Animals, Department of Intelligent Animal Husbandry, Department of Basic Veterinary Medicine, Department
              of Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary
              Pharmacology, and Department of Public Health.
            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              Currently, the college has 216 staff members, including 171 full-time faculty members (86 professors, 79
              associate professors), 25 technical personnel, and 20 administrative staff. There are also 59 postdoctoral
              researchers.
            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              There are currently two undergraduate programs in Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, both of which
              are national characteristic and Hubei provincial brand programs. They have been selected as the first
              batch of national first-class professional construction sites. The college offers three doctoral degree
              programs in Animal Science, Veterinary Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine (professional degree).
              Additionally, it has two postdoctoral research stations in Animal Breeding and Reproduction, and Animal
              Nutrition and Feed Science. The college also offers eight secondary disciplines, including Animal Genetics
              and Breeding, Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Special Economic Animal Rearing, Animal Production and
              Livestock Engineering, Basic Veterinary Medicine, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Clinical Veterinary
              Medicine, and Veterinary Public Health and Food Safety. Each year, the college admits over 350
              undergraduate students, 550 master’s students, and 180 doctoral students. Currently, there are 3,715
              students enrolled, including 1,668 undergraduates, 1,356 master’s students (8 international students), and
              691 doctoral students (50 international students).

            <p class="info-label">
              In recent years, the disciplines of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine have ranked among the top
              universities in China. In 2017, both programs were selected as “Double First-Class” disciplines by the
              national government and received an A+ rating in the fourth round of discipline evaluation. In 2021, both
              programs were once again selected as “Double First-Class” disciplines.
            </p>
            <p class="info-label">
              The college has 38 research platform bases at the provincial and ministerial levels or above. Among them,
              there are 10 national level platform bases, 5 international science and technology cooperation platform
              bases, 23 provincial and ministerial level platform bases.
