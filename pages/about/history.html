        </div>
        <p class="label">
          College of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine is one of the earliest departments established at Huazhong
          Agricultural University. In 1898, Mr. Zhang Zhidong, the governor of Hubei and Hunan provinces, founded the
          Hubei Agricultural School (predecessor of Huazhong Agricultural University) and invited those who were
          interested in pursuing agricultural studies to join the school and study plant cultivation and animal
          husbandry. In 1902, the school was renamed Hubei Higher Agricultural School and began offering three
          disciplines: agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. In 1916, the school was divided into two, and the
          Hubei Second Senior Agricultural School established the Department of Veterinary Medicine (3-year program).
        </p>
        <p class="label">
          In 1952, as part of a nationwide restructuring of colleges and departments, the Animal Husbandry and
          Veterinary Department was established at Huazhong Agricultural College, with Professor Qin Liran, a renowned
          veterinarian, serving as the first department head. In October 1995, the College of Animal Science and
          Veterinary Medicine was established at Huazhong Agricultural University, and in July 2002, it was renamed the
          College of Animal Science and Technology and the College of Veterinary Medicine.


        </p>
        <p class="label">
          Over the more than 70 years since its establishment, the college has upheld the principles of “unity, rigor,
          pragmatism, and innovation” and carried forward the spirit of “innovation, creation, and entrepreneurship.” It
          has adhered to the concept of “talent-oriented, technology-driven, and industry-advancing,” making great
          efforts to promote the development and growth of the college. As a result, the college has developed a
          distinctive discipline advantage and a comprehensive educational system.
        </p>
        <p class="label">
          The college comprises nine departments, including the Department of Animal Genetics and Breeding, Department
          of Animal Nutrition and Feed Science, Department of Animal Reproduction and Special Economic Animals,
          Department of Intelligent Animal Husbandry, Department of Basic Veterinary Medicine, Department of Preventive
          Veterinary Medicine, Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, Department of Veterinary Pharmacology, and
          Department of Public Health.


        </p>
        <p class="label">
          Currently, the college has 216 staff members, including 171 full-time faculty members (86 professors, 79
          associate professors), 25 technical personnel, and 20 administrative staff. There are also 59 postdoctoral
          researchers. The college has one national-level teaching team named after Huang Danian, two national-level
          innovative research groups funded by the National Natural Science Foundation, and 18 innovation teams at the
          ministry or provincial level. It also boasts one academician, one expert participating in the national
          long-term talent project for innovation, seven recipients of the National Distinguished Fund, six recipients
          of the National Outstanding Youth Science Fund, eight recipients of the Outstanding Youth Fund for Overseas
          Scholars, 11 individuals selected for the national-level youth talent project, five individuals selected for
          the national-level “New Century Millions of Talents Project,” nine scientists holding positions in the
          National Modern Agricultural Industry Technology System, and 14 individuals selected for the Ministry of
          Education’s “New Century (Cross-Century) Excellent Talents Supporting Program.”


        </p>
        <p class="label">
          There are currently two undergraduate programs in Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine, both of which are
          national characteristic and Hubei provincial brand programs. They have been selected as the first batch of
          national first-class professional construction sites. The college offers three doctoral degree programs in
          Animal Science, Veterinary Medicine, and Veterinary Medicine (professional degree). Additionally, it has two
          postdoctoral research stations in Animal Breeding and Reproduction, and Animal Nutrition and Feed Science. The
          college also offers eight secondary disciplines, including Animal Genetics and Breeding, Animal Nutrition and
          Feed Science, Special Economic Animal Rearing, Animal Production and Livestock Engineering, Basic Veterinary
          Medicine, Preventive Veterinary Medicine, Clinical Veterinary Medicine, and Veterinary Public Health and Food
          Safety. Each year, the college admits over 350 undergraduate students, 550 master’s students, and 180 doctoral
          students. Currently, there are 3,715 students enrolled, including 1,668 undergraduates, 1,356 master’s
          students (8 international students), and 691 doctoral students (50 international students).


        </p>
        <p class="label">
          In recent years, the disciplines of Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine have ranked among the top
          universities in China. In 2017, both programs were selected as “Double First-Class” disciplines by the
          national government and received an A+ rating in the fourth round of discipline evaluation. In 2021, both
          programs were once again selected as “Double First-Class” disciplines.
